- Ayurveda is a 5,000-year-old system of natural healing that’s truly stood the test of time. First originating in the Vedic culture of India, it’s actually considered by many to be the oldest healing science there is.
- The primary goal of Ayurvedic medicine is to help people live long, healthy and balanced lives without the need for prescription drugs, complicated surgeries or suffering through painful conditions.
- One of the core principles of Ayurveda, and what makes it stand apart from western medicine, is that it takes into account bio-individuality and a patient’s entire body-mind-spirit connection. 
- Rather than treating symptoms with drugs and ignoring the underlying problems, Ayurvedic medicine aims to look at the root of disease and how it’s related to a person’s thoughts, beliefs and lifestyle — in other words, a person’s “vital energy.”
- What’s especially of interest to researchers studying traditional healing symptoms like Ayurveda is the power of the mind and its connection to the body.
